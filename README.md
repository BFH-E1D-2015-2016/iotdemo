### Developing new features / bug fix

#### For beginner
This application is developed using the Django web framework and the TDD
(`Test Driven Development`) methodology. The best way to learn Python, 
Django and TDD is to learn this great book: 

[Test-Driven Development with Python](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/).

#### For average programmer

We use the Django Web Framework, our test are written to run with PyTest
and we use Selenium to do our fonctional testing.
